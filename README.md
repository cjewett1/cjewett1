<h2>Hi there, my name is Clint! ðŸ˜„ <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=cjewett1&style=for-the-badge" alt="Profile Views" align="right"></h2>

<h3>I'm a Junior Web Developer <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83998647/229268354-3f8b0a6e-3f62-4c8e-9fda-7411f09baef8.png" alt="my-personal-logo" align="right"></h3>

As an enthusiastic lover of all things computer-related, I have an insatiable curiosity when it comes to website development and the intricate mechanics of how it all fits together. Thereâ€™s just something about the way that coding can bring complex designs and ideas to life that never fails to capture my imagination.

I'm also a resourceful individual who enjoys a challenge. I take pride in delivering high-quality work and prioritizing the users experience. With a strong sense of ownership and responsibility, I am always willing to go above and beyond. I may not know everything, and belive me, I dont, but I am always willing to put in the time to learn and adapt. I graduate from NAIT's Web Design and Development program in May and I am beyond excited to start my career in this wonderful industry. Thanks for stopping by!
